# Rules, Testing & Quality

## NEVER Do

Every item below has caused rejected PRs. Each has a reason — not arbitrary style.

### Naming
- **NEVER use "Request" for parameter types** — always "Options". The entire SDK uses `{Entity}{Operation}Options`. Using "Request" creates inconsistency and confuses the public API. (`TaskAssignmentOptions`, not `TaskAssignmentRequest`)
- **NEVER use `batch` prefix** for batch methods — use plural names instead. `insertRecordsById`, not `batchInsertRecords`. The SDK convention is singular/plural to distinguish cardinality.

### Types
- **NEVER use `any` type** — use `unknown` then validate.
- **NEVER use `as unknown as` type casts** — refactor to make types flow naturally. Casts hide real type errors and break when upstream types change.
- **NEVER make all fields required** if the API sometimes omits them — mark optional fields as optional. Over-requiring causes runtime `undefined` access on fields the API didn't return.
- **NEVER leave raw strings/numbers for fixed value sets** — use enums. Raw values lose type safety and autocomplete. If the API returns `1`, `2`, `3` for status, map them to a `Status` enum.
- **NEVER duplicate fields across option types** — extend existing ones. If `CaseInstanceOperationOptions` already has `comment`, extend it instead of re-declaring. When the shape is identical, use `extends` (e.g., `export interface EntityUpdateRecordByIdOptions extends EntityGetRecordByIdOptions {}`) instead of a type alias, as type aliases break TypeDoc documentation generation.
- **NEVER use type aliases for response types** — even when the shape matches an existing one, use an `extends` interface. Type aliases (e.g., `export type EntityUpdateRecordResponse = EntityRecord`) break TypeDoc docs generation by not rendering as standalone types. Use `export interface EntityUpdateRecordResponse extends EntityRecord {}` instead.
- **NEVER write `param || {}` for required parameters** — this hides bugs by silently accepting missing required data at call sites.

### Transforms
- **NEVER add case-only entries to `{Entity}Map`** — field maps are for semantic renames only (`creationTime` → `createdTime`). Case conversion (`CreationTime` → `creationTime`) is handled by `pascalToCamelCaseKeys()`. Mixing them causes double-conversion bugs and makes the map lie about its purpose.
- **NEVER add transform steps without checking the actual API response first** — if the API already returns camelCase, don't add `pascalToCamelCaseKeys()`. If it doesn't return raw enum codes, don't add `applyDataTransforms()`. Each step must be justified by what the API actually sends.
- **NEVER skip transformations** — never return raw API responses; apply applicable pipeline steps.

### Method binding
- **NEVER bind `getAll()`, `getById()`, `create()`** to response objects — these are service-level entry points, not entity operations. Binding them creates circular nonsense (an entity that retrieves itself).
- **NEVER add `{Entity}Methods` to read-only services** — Assets, Buckets, Queues, Processes, ChoiceSets, Cases, ProcessIncidents have no mutations, so no methods to bind.

### Internal types
- **NEVER re-export `internal-types.ts` through index.ts** — these are private implementation details (raw API shapes, intermediate parsing types). Re-exporting pollutes the public API and creates breaking-change risk when internal formats change.

### Endpoints
- **NEVER bypass base service classes** — never directly instantiate HTTP clients; use `this.get()`, `this.post()` from BaseService.
- **NEVER hardcode HTTP method strings in service methods** — use existing constants. Hardcoded strings drift and miss centralized changes.
- **NEVER use inconsistent param names** across endpoints in the same group — if one endpoint uses `instanceId`, all should. Mixing `id`/`instanceId` creates confusion when reading endpoint constants.
- **NEVER use redundant names** in nested groups — under a `CASE` group, use `REOPEN` not `REOPEN_CASE`. The group context already provides the prefix.

### OperationResponse
- **NEVER use `OperationResponse` for `getAll()`, `getById()`, `create()`** — these return entity data directly. `OperationResponse` is only for state-change operations (cancel, pause, resume) and bulk OData operations with ambiguous success.

### Pagination
- **NEVER implement pagination manually** — always use `PaginationHelpers.getAll()`.

### Tests
- **NEVER write test descriptions that don't match the code** — `'should call entity.insert'` is wrong if testing `insertRecord()`. Mismatched descriptions make failures misleading.
- **NEVER hardcode test values** — use existing constants from `tests/utils/constants/`. Hardcoded values drift and hide which test is using which fixture.
- **NEVER leave unused mock methods in mock objects** — dead mocks obscure what the test actually exercises and accumulate as the API evolves.
- **NEVER use `console.log` + `return` in integration test guards** — use `throw new Error()`. Silent skips hide missing test configuration and make CI green when tests aren't actually running.
- **NEVER wrap integration test API calls in try/catch** — let errors propagate naturally. Silent catches mask real failures and make tests pass when they should fail.
- **NEVER create a separate `afterAll` per describe block** if the file already has one — reuse the existing cleanup block by pushing to the shared `createdRecordIds` array.
- **NEVER copy-paste JSDoc comments between endpoint groups** — each constant needs its own comment. A "Asset Service Endpoints" comment on `JOB_ENDPOINTS` is a review rejection.

### Code hygiene
- **NEVER leave unused code** — unused imports, variables, redundant constructors that only call `super()`. Linter (oxlint) catches these.
- **NEVER add redundant constructors** — if the constructor only calls `super()`, delete it entirely.
- **NEVER commit sensitive files** — `.env`, `credentials.json`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, hardcoded API keys/tokens.

### Docs
- **NEVER skip `docs/oauth-scopes.md` when adding a method** — every public method needs its scope listed in the same PR. Missing scopes break the OAuth integration guide.
- **NEVER skip `docs/pagination.md` when adding a paginated method** — update the quick reference table with the new method and `jumpToPage` support. Users rely on this table to know which methods support pagination.
- **NEVER skip `mkdocs.yml` when adding a new service** — the new service page won't appear in the docs site navigation without a nav entry. Existing services adding methods don't need this.
- **NEVER skip `@track()` decorator** on public service methods — telemetry gaps are invisible until production debugging, when they're expensive.
- **NEVER use PascalCase in JSDoc examples** — write `id` not `Id`. Examples must match the SDK's post-transform response format or users will write broken code.

## Testing guidelines

- Tests use `vitest` with `vi.mock()` and `vi.hoisted()`. Shared mocks in `tests/utils/mocks/`. Use `createMockApiClient()` and `createServiceTestDependencies()` from `tests/utils/setup.ts`.
- **Arrange-Act-Assert** pattern. Reset mocks in `afterEach`.
- Test both **success and error scenarios** for every public method.
- Test descriptions must match what's being tested.
- Type request objects in tests — don't leave as untyped objects.
- Use existing test constants from `tests/utils/constants/` instead of hardcoding values.
- Verify bound methods exist on response objects when `getById` returns entities with attached methods.
- **Coverage**: 80% minimum for new code, 100% for critical paths (auth, API calls).
- Remove unused mock methods. Extract repeated logic into shared helpers.

### Integration tests

Every new method must also have an integration test in `tests/integration/shared/{domain}/`. These run against a live API and catch issues unit tests miss — wrong endpoints, broken transforms, auth/header problems.

- Use `getServices()` and `getTestConfig()` from `tests/integration/config/unified-setup.ts`
- Use `registerResource()` from `tests/integration/utils/cleanup.ts` for cleanup tracking
- Use `generateRandomString()` from `tests/integration/utils/helpers.ts` for unique test data
- Tests run in both `v0` and `v1` init modes via `describe.each(modes)`

## Documentation

JSDoc comments in `src/models/{domain}/*.models.ts` are the **source of truth for the public API docs site**. TypeDoc (`typedoc.json`) runs on `src/index.ts`.

- `{Entity}ServiceModel` interfaces become the main API reference pages.
- Use `@example` with fenced TypeScript blocks, `@param`, `@returns`, `{@link TypeName}`.
- Tag internal code with `@internal` or `@ignore`.
- When adding methods, update `docs/oauth-scopes.md` with required OAuth scopes.
- Run `npm run docs:api` to regenerate.

**JSDoc quality rules:**
- Link response types with `{@link TypeName}` in every method's JSDoc.
- Show how to get prerequisite IDs (e.g., "First, get entities with `entities.getAll()`").
- Use `<paramName>` placeholder convention for IDs in examples.
- Use camelCase in examples, matching SDK response format.
- Keep JSDoc in sync with method names.

## Post-implementation verification checklist

Run after every implementation, before committing.

```bash
npm run typecheck     # TypeScript compilation — must be clean
npm run lint          # oxlint — 0 errors
npm run test:unit     # All unit tests pass
npm run build         # Rollup build produces dist/ output
```

Manual checks:
- [ ] No `any` types, unused imports, or redundant constructors
- [ ] Transform pipeline matches actual raw API response (not assumptions)
- [ ] Types reuse existing shapes where possible (aliases, not duplicates)
- [ ] All `@track('ServiceName.MethodName')` decorators present on public methods
- [ ] JSDoc complete on `{Entity}ServiceModel` interface with `@example`, `@param`, `@returns`
- [ ] Unit tests cover success + error paths for every public method
- [ ] Integration test written in `tests/integration/shared/{domain}/`

Documentation (the most commonly missed step):
- [ ] `docs/oauth-scopes.md` — new method's OAuth scope added
- [ ] `docs/pagination.md` — quick reference table updated (if paginated method)
- [ ] `mkdocs.yml` — nav entry added (if new service, not needed for methods on existing services)
- [ ] `package.json` exports + `rollup.config.js` — subpath export added (if new service)

## Skills for SDK development

**Invoke the `onboard-api` skill** for any work that involves adding API endpoints to the SDK — whether onboarding a new service or adding methods to an existing one. This includes:
- Adding a new service from a Swagger/OpenAPI spec URL
- Onboarding an endpoint described in a Jira ticket (provide the ticket key/URL)
- Adding a new method or service from a direct endpoint description
- Adding methods to an existing service

The `onboard-api` skill handles the full workflow: input collection → PAT token + live API curl → design decisions → implementation → testing → E2E validation → Cloudflare Workers whitelisting → commit + PR. All coding follows the conventions in these agent docs.

For non-onboarding changes (bug fixes, refactoring, reviewing code, updating tests), no skill is needed — the conventions in these files apply directly.
