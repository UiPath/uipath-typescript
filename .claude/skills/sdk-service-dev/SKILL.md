# SDK Service Development Guide

Guide for adding, modifying, or reviewing services in `@uipath/uipath-typescript`. Every pattern here is enforced in code review.

**Detailed references:** [onboarding](references/onboarding.md) | [transforms](references/transforms.md) | [pagination](references/pagination.md) | [testing](references/testing.md) | [e2e-testing](references/e2e-testing.md) | [jsdoc](references/jsdoc.md)

## NEVER Do

Every item below has caused rejected PRs. Each has a reason — not arbitrary style.

### Naming
- **NEVER use "Request" for parameter types** — always "Options". The entire SDK uses `{Entity}{Operation}Options`. Using "Request" creates inconsistency and confuses the public API. (`TaskAssignmentOptions`, not `TaskAssignmentRequest`)
- **NEVER use `batch` prefix** for batch methods — use plural names instead. `insertRecordsById`, not `batchInsertRecords`. The SDK convention is singular/plural to distinguish cardinality.

### Types
- **NEVER use `as unknown as` type casts** — refactor to make types flow naturally. Casts hide real type errors and break when upstream types change.
- **NEVER make all fields required** if the API sometimes omits them — mark optional fields as optional. Over-requiring causes runtime `undefined` access on fields the API didn't return.
- **NEVER leave raw strings/numbers for fixed value sets** — use enums. Raw values lose type safety and autocomplete. If the API returns `1`, `2`, `3` for status, map them to a `Status` enum.
- **NEVER duplicate fields across option types** — extend existing ones. If `CaseInstanceOperationOptions` already has `comment`, extend it instead of re-declaring. When the shape is identical, use a type alias (`export type EntityUpdateRecordByIdOptions = EntityGetRecordByIdOptions`) instead of creating a new interface with the same fields.
- **NEVER create a new response type when the shape matches an existing one** — use a type alias. If `updateRecordById` returns the same shape as `EntityRecord`, write `export type EntityUpdateRecordResponse = EntityRecord`.
- **NEVER write `param || {}` for required parameters** — this hides bugs by silently accepting missing required data at call sites.

### Transforms
- **NEVER add case-only entries to `{Entity}Map`** — field maps are for semantic renames only (`creationTime` → `createdTime`). Case conversion (`CreationTime` → `creationTime`) is handled by `pascalToCamelCaseKeys()`. Mixing them causes double-conversion bugs and makes the map lie about its purpose.
- **NEVER add transform steps without checking the actual API response first** — if the API already returns camelCase, don't add `pascalToCamelCaseKeys()`. If it doesn't return raw enum codes, don't add `applyDataTransforms()`. Each step must be justified by what the API actually sends.

### Method binding
- **NEVER bind `getAll()`, `getById()`, `create()`** to response objects — these are service-level entry points, not entity operations. Binding them creates circular nonsense (an entity that retrieves itself).
- **NEVER add `{Entity}Methods` to read-only services** — Assets, Buckets, Queues, Processes, ChoiceSets, Cases, ProcessIncidents have no mutations, so no methods to bind.

### Internal types
- **NEVER re-export `internal-types.ts` through index.ts** — these are private implementation details (raw API shapes, intermediate parsing types). Re-exporting pollutes the public API and creates breaking-change risk when internal formats change.

### Endpoints
- **NEVER hardcode HTTP method strings in service methods** — use existing constants. Hardcoded strings drift and miss centralized changes.
- **NEVER use inconsistent param names** across endpoints in the same group — if one endpoint uses `instanceId`, all should. Mixing `id`/`instanceId` creates confusion when reading endpoint constants.
- **NEVER use redundant names** in nested groups — under a `CASE` group, use `REOPEN` not `REOPEN_CASE`. The group context already provides the prefix.

### OperationResponse
- **NEVER use `OperationResponse` for `getAll()`, `getById()`, `create()`** — these return entity data directly. `OperationResponse` is only for state-change operations (cancel, pause, resume) and bulk OData operations with ambiguous success.

### Tests
- **NEVER write test descriptions that don't match the code** — `'should call entity.insert'` is wrong if testing `insertRecord()`. Mismatched descriptions make failures misleading.
- **NEVER hardcode test values** — use existing constants from `tests/utils/constants/`. Hardcoded values drift and hide which test is using which fixture.
- **NEVER leave unused mock methods in mock objects** — dead mocks obscure what the test actually exercises and accumulate as the API evolves.
- **NEVER use `console.log` + `return` in integration test guards** — use `throw new Error()`. Silent skips hide missing test configuration and make CI green when tests aren't actually running. (ref: [PR #249](https://github.com/UiPath/uipath-typescript/pull/249), [PR #276](https://github.com/UiPath/uipath-typescript/pull/276))
- **NEVER wrap integration test API calls in try/catch** — let errors propagate naturally. Silent catches mask real failures and make tests pass when they should fail.
- **NEVER create a separate `afterAll` per describe block** if the file already has one — reuse the existing cleanup block by pushing to the shared `createdRecordIds` array.

### Endpoints
- **NEVER copy-paste JSDoc comments between endpoint groups** — each constant needs its own comment. A "Asset Service Endpoints" comment on `JOB_ENDPOINTS` is a review rejection.

### Docs
- **NEVER skip `docs/oauth-scopes.md` when adding a method** — every public method needs its scope listed in the same PR. Missing scopes break the OAuth integration guide.
- **NEVER skip `docs/pagination.md` when adding a paginated method** — update the quick reference table with the new method and `jumpToPage` support. Users rely on this table to know which methods support pagination.
- **NEVER skip `mkdocs.yml` when adding a new service** — the new service page won't appear in the docs site navigation without a nav entry. Existing services adding methods don't need this.
- **NEVER skip `@track()` decorator** on public service methods — telemetry gaps are invisible until production debugging, when they're expensive.
- **NEVER use PascalCase in JSDoc examples** — write `id` not `Id`. Examples must match the SDK's post-transform response format or users will write broken code.

## Onboarding a New API — Decision Trees

See [references/onboarding.md](references/onboarding.md) for full placement patterns, response design guide, build system checklist, binding examples, and the DX philosophy.

**What the user provides:** (1) Swagger/OpenAPI spec or API docs URL, (2) which endpoints to onboard. The agent handles everything else — token extraction, calling live endpoints, inspecting responses, making design decisions, writing code.

### Step 0: Read PAT Token & Curl Live API (BLOCKING)

**This step is mandatory. Do NOT proceed to implementation without a real API response.**

#### Token source

Read the PAT (Personal Access Token) from `.env.skills` in the repo root. Expected format:

```
PAT_TOKEN=rt_...
BASE_URL=https://alpha.uipath.com
ORG_NAME=popoc
TENANT_NAME=adetenant
```

1. **Read `.env.skills`** and parse `PAT_TOKEN`. If the file is missing or `PAT_TOKEN` is empty, stop and ask the user to populate it before continuing.
2. **Also read `BASE_URL`, `ORG_NAME`, `TENANT_NAME`** for constructing curl URLs. Fall back to defaults (`https://alpha.uipath.com`, `popoc`, `adetenant`) if not set.
3. **Use the PAT as a Bearer token** in curl requests: `Authorization: Bearer <PAT_TOKEN>`.

#### Curl live endpoints

4. **Curl each endpoint** being onboarded using the token. Capture the full raw JSON response.
5. **If the curl fails with 401** (token expired or invalid), stop and tell the user to refresh the PAT in `.env.skills`.
6. **If the curl fails** (403, 404, network error), stop and report the error. Do not guess the response shape from the Swagger spec alone.
7. **If the user explicitly opts out** of the entire step (e.g., "skip curl, use spec only"), warn them that type decisions may be wrong and note it as a risk — but allow it.

Without a real response, you cannot reliably decide: which fields are optional, what casing the API uses, whether enum values come as strings or numbers, or which fields are actually null in practice. The Swagger spec is often incomplete or wrong on these details.

### SDK Response Design

**Only after you have a real API response**, inspect it and decide what the SDK type should look like.

```
For each field in the raw API response:
  │
  Is it internal metadata, storage metrics, config flags, or validation artifacts?
  YES → DROP it. Don't include in SDK type. (Raw shape goes in internal-types.ts)
  │
  NO → Does the field name break SDK conventions?
       (wrong case, UTC suffix, platform jargon like organizationUnitId)
       YES → RENAME it via {Entity}Map in constants.ts
       NO  → KEEP as-is
```

```
For the response structure as a whole:
  │
  Is the shape untyped/flat where it should be structured?
  (e.g., flat key-value map instead of typed array with metadata)
  YES → RESHAPE in the service method. Build the new structure manually.
  │
  Is context missing that would require the developer to make extra API calls?
  (e.g., only element IDs but no human-readable names)
  YES → ENRICH by fetching additional context (e.g., BPMN XML).
        Always degrade gracefully if enrichment source fails.
```

Different endpoints for the same service may need different transform pipelines — inspect each independently.

### Service Placement

```
Is this API a sub-resource of an existing entity?
(instances, incidents, history, attachments OF a parent)
  │
  YES → Hierarchical Sub-Service
  │     File inside parent's folder. Shares parent's import path.
  │     Ex: ProcessInstances inside maestro/processes/
  │
  NO → Is it related to an existing service? (same domain, same audience)
       │
       YES → Would a developer commonly use one without the other?
       │     │
       │     OFTEN YES → Independent Root Service
       │     │            Own import path + rollup entry.
       │     │            Ex: Assets, Queues (both Orchestrator, separate imports)
       │     │
       │     OFTEN NO  → Domain-Grouped Service
       │                  Sibling file, shared import path. No runtime dependency.
       │                  Ex: ChoiceSets with Entities (both Data Fabric, one import)
       │
       NO → Independent Root Service
```

**Existing service map:**

| Import path | Services | Pattern |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| `/entities` | Entities, ChoiceSets | Domain-grouped (Data Fabric peers) |
| `/tasks` | Tasks | Independent root |
| `/assets`, `/queues`, `/buckets`, `/processes` | Assets, Queues, Buckets, Processes | Independent root (Orchestrator) |
| `/cases` | Cases, CaseInstances | Hierarchical (Cases → CaseInstances) |
| `/maestro-processes` | MaestroProcesses, ProcessInstances, ProcessIncidents | Hierarchical (Process → Instance → Incident) |

### Method Binding

The core DX rule: **a developer should never extract an ID from a response just to pass it back to another method.** Bound methods capture all identifying context (id, folderId, folderKey) from the response object and remove those params from the method signature.

```
For each method in the new API:
  │
  Does it operate ON a specific entity already retrieved?
  │
  YES → BIND IT
  │     Capture all context (id, folderId, folderKey) from response object.
  │     Remove captured params from signature. Keep data/options params.
  │     Service-level: insertRecordById(id, data) → Bound: insertRecord(data)
  │
  NO → DON'T BIND — keep as service-level method
       Entry points (getAll, getById, create), cross-entity queries
```

## File Structure

Each domain needs 3 files in `src/models/{domain}/`:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `{domain}.types.ts` | Public interfaces, options types, enums (re-exported via index.ts) |
| `{domain}.constants.ts` | Field maps, status maps, expand defaults, pagination constants |
| `{domain}.models.ts` | `{Entity}ServiceModel`, `{Entity}Methods`, composed response type, `create{Entity}WithMethods()` factory |

Optional: `{domain}.internal-types.ts` for private types (raw API shapes, intermediate parsing types, internal enums). Never re-exported.

Service implementation goes in `src/services/{area}/{domain}/`, endpoints in `src/utils/constants/endpoints.ts`, pagination constants in `src/utils/constants/common.ts`.

**Reference example:** Action Center Tasks — types in `src/models/action-center/tasks.types.ts`, constants in `tasks.constants.ts`, models in `tasks.models.ts`, implementation in `src/services/action-center/tasks.ts`.

## Type Naming Quick Reference

| Pattern | Use |
|---------|-----|
| `{Entity}GetResponse` / `GetAllResponse` | Read responses |
| `{Entity}InsertResponse` / `UpdateResponse` / `DeleteResponse` | Mutation responses |
| `Raw{Entity}GetResponse` | Internal shape before method attachment (in `types.ts`) |
| `{Entity}GetResponse = Raw... & {Entity}Methods` | Final type with bound methods (in `models.ts`) |
| `{Entity}GetAllOptions` / `GetByIdOptions` / `{Operation}Options` | Always "Options" — never "Request" |

Compose list options with `RequestOptions & PaginationOptions & { ... }`. Base types from `src/models/common/types.ts`: `BaseOptions`, `RequestOptions`, `OperationResponse<TData>`.

Method names: **singular** for single-item ops (`insertRecordById`), **plural** for batch (`insertRecordsById`). Prefer plurals over `batch` prefix.

**Singular vs batch — request body and options differences:**

| Aspect | Singular (e.g., `updateRecordById`) | Batch (e.g., `updateRecordsById`) |
|--------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Body type | `Record<string, any>` — ID is in the URL, not the body | `EntityRecord[]` — each item needs its own `Id` |
| `failOnFirst` | Not applicable — single item, nothing to fail-first on | Available as an option |
| URL pattern | `.../update/${recordId}` (ID in path) | `.../update-batch` (IDs in body) |

## BaseService vs FolderScopedService — Decision Tree

```
Does the API require X-UIPATH-OrganizationUnitId header
AND return OData value arrays?
  YES → extend FolderScopedService (src/services/folder-scoped.ts)
        Uses: _getByFolder(endpoint, folderId, options?, transformFn?)
        Examples: Assets, Queues, Buckets
  NO  → extend BaseService (src/services/base.ts)
        Handle folder context per-method with createHeaders()
        Examples: Data Fabric, Maestro, Action Center, Orchestrator Processes
```

**Headers:** `createHeaders()` from `src/utils/http/headers.ts`. Orchestrator uses `createHeaders({ [FOLDER_ID]: folderId })` (numeric). Maestro uses `createHeaders({ [FOLDER_KEY]: folderKey })` (string). Import constants from `src/utils/constants/common`.

## Response Transforms — Decision Tree

See [references/transforms.md](references/transforms.md) for full pipeline details, standard field renames, and outbound transform patterns.

```
Check the raw API response, then apply steps in order (skip any that don't apply):

1. PascalCase keys?        → pascalToCamelCaseKeys(response.data)
2. Fields need renaming?   → transformData(data, {Entity}Map)       [semantic renames ONLY]
3. Raw enum codes?         → applyDataTransforms(data, { field, valueMap })
4. Entity has operations?  → create{Entity}WithMethods(data, this)
```

All transform functions in `src/utils/transform.ts`. Field maps are for semantic renames only — never case conversion.

## Method Attachment — Implementation

For the binding decision tree and DX rationale, see [Onboarding: Method Binding](#method-binding) above and [references/onboarding.md](references/onboarding.md).

**Implementation pattern:** `create{Entity}Methods(rawData, service)` returns bound async methods that capture all identifying context (id, folderId, folderKey) from the response. `create{Entity}WithMethods(rawData, service)` merges via `Object.assign({}, rawData, methods)`. Methods validate required fields (`if (!data.id) throw new Error(...)`) before delegating.

Read-only services have no `{Entity}Methods`: Assets, Buckets, Queues, Processes, ChoiceSets, Cases, ProcessIncidents.

## Pagination — Decision Tree

See [references/pagination.md](references/pagination.md) for constants definitions, `excludeFromPrefix` rules, and step-by-step setup.

```
Does the API return paginated lists?
  NO  → use raw HTTP call
  YES → use PaginationHelpers.getAll() from src/utils/pagination/helpers.ts
        │
        What pagination style?
        ├─ OData ($top/$skip/$count, value array, @odata.count)
        │  → PaginationType.OFFSET — supports jumpToPage
        │    Reuse ODATA_PAGINATION + ODATA_OFFSET_PARAMS if standard shape
        │
        └─ Continuation token (named array, token field)
           → PaginationType.TOKEN — NO jumpToPage
             Define service-specific constants
```

Return type: conditional via `HasPaginationOptions<T>` → `PaginatedResponse<T>` or `NonPaginatedResponse<T>`.

## OperationResponse Pattern

`OperationResponse<TData>` from `src/models/common/types.ts`: `{ success: boolean, data: TData }`.

| Scenario | Pattern |
|----------|---------|
| Lifecycle ops (cancel, pause, resume, close, reopen) | `{ success: true, data: response.data }` — failures throw |
| Bulk OData ops (assign, unassign) with 200-on-failure | `processODataArrayResponse()` from `src/utils/object.ts` |
| `getAll()`, `getById()`, `create()` | Don't use — return entity data directly |

## Endpoint Constants

In `src/utils/constants/endpoints.ts`, grouped by service. All objects use `as const`.

- Static: `GET_ALL: '${BASE}/api/v1/entities'`
- Parameterized: `GET_BY_ID: (id: string) => '${BASE}/api/v1/entities/${id}'`
- Nested: `ATTACHMENT: { DOWNLOAD: (id, attachmentId) => ... }`

Rules: consistent param names across endpoints, no redundancy (under `CASE` group use `REOPEN` not `REOPEN_CASE`).

## Export Naming

Internal class: `{Entity}Service`. Public alias in `index.ts`: plural noun (`EntityService as Entities`). Both exported. When adding a service, update `package.json` `exports` + `rollup.config.js`.

## Testing & Documentation

See [references/testing.md](references/testing.md) for vitest setup, mock patterns, test rules, and integration testing.

See [references/jsdoc.md](references/jsdoc.md) for JSDoc conventions, telemetry decorators, and required doc file updates.

### Integration Tests

Every new method must have an integration test in `tests/integration/shared/{domain}/`. These run against a live API and catch issues unit tests miss — wrong endpoints, broken transforms, auth header problems.

**Pattern:**
```typescript
it('should <operation> successfully', async () => {
  const { serviceName } = getServices();
  const config = getTestConfig();
  const entityId = config.testEntityId || fallbackId;

  if (!entityId) {
    throw new Error('No entity ID available for testing. Set TEST_ENTITY_ID.');
  }

  const result = await serviceName.newMethod(entityId, data);
  expect(result).toBeDefined();
  // Assert on key fields
});
```

**Rules:** See [NEVER Do → Tests](#tests) for guard clause, error handling, and afterAll rules.
- Use `generateRandomString()` for test data to avoid collisions
- Register created resources with `registerResource()` for cleanup

## Post-Implementation Verification Checklist

**Run this checklist after every implementation, before committing.** Do not skip items — each has caused rejected PRs.

### Code verification
```bash
npm run typecheck     # TypeScript compilation — must be clean
npm run lint          # oxlint — 0 errors
npm run test:unit     # All unit tests pass
npm run build         # Rollup build produces dist/{service}/ output
```

### Manual verification
- [ ] No `any` types, unused imports, or redundant constructors
- [ ] Transform pipeline matches actual raw API response (not assumptions)
- [ ] Types reuse existing shapes where possible (aliases, not duplicates)
- [ ] All `@track('ServiceName.MethodName')` decorators present on public methods
- [ ] JSDoc complete on `{Entity}ServiceModel` interface with `@example`, `@param`, `@returns`
- [ ] Unit tests cover success + error paths for every public method
- [ ] Integration test written in `tests/integration/shared/{domain}/`

### Documentation — the most commonly missed step
- [ ] **`docs/oauth-scopes.md`** — new method's OAuth scope added
- [ ] **`docs/pagination.md`** — quick reference table updated (if paginated method)
- [ ] **`mkdocs.yml`** — nav entry added (if new service, not needed for methods on existing services)
- [ ] **`package.json` exports + `rollup.config.js`** — subpath export added (if new service)

## E2E Validation

See [references/e2e-testing.md](references/e2e-testing.md) for the full workflow.

After implementing a new service, validate it end-to-end by scaffolding a **temporary** React app at `samples/e2e-test/`. The app uses PAT auth (from `.env.skills`) — no OAuth, no Playwright, no login flow. The entire app is deleted after validation.

```
1. npm run build && npm version 1.0.0-test.1 --no-git-tag-version && npm pack
2. Scaffold temp app at samples/e2e-test/ (React + Vite + Tailwind, PAT auth)
3. Generate test component tailored to onboarded methods — UI matches method types
4. npm install && npm run dev → open browser, interact with test UI
5. Verify: imports resolve, fields are camelCase, dropped fields absent,
   bound methods exist, pagination shape correct
6. Delete entire app — rm -rf samples/e2e-test, delete tarball, revert version
```
